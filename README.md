# Feature Reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

This project demonstrates how to perform feature reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data by transforming the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. The goal is to retain as much variance in the data as possible while reducing the number of features.

## Introduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a commonly used technique for dimensionality reduction. By transforming the original features into a smaller set of principal components, PCA helps simplify data, remove noise, and improve model performance. This project demonstrates how to use PCA to reduce features in a dataset while retaining as much variance as possible.

## Features

- Uses PCA for feature reduction in a dataset.
- Retains a specified amount of variance while reducing the number of features.
- Can handle different datasets and data formats.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    - Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
    - Run the script to perform PCA for feature reduction.
    ```bash
    python pca_reduction.py
    ```

2. **Provide Input Parameters**:
    - The script will prompt you to input parameters such as the number of principal components or the variance ratio to retain.

3. **Receive Reduced Data**:
    - The system will display the data with reduced features based on the input parameters.

## Data

- The dataset used in this project can be any dataset with multiple features that require dimensionality reduction.
- The data can be preprocessed as needed before applying PCA.

## PCA Method

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces the dimensionality of data by transforming the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.
- PCA proceeds as follows:
    - **Standardize the Data**: The data is standardized so that each feature has a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.
    - **Calculate Covariance Matrix**: The covariance matrix of the data is calculated.
    - **Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix are computed.
    - **Sort and Select Principal Components**: The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are sorted by eigenvalue magnitude, and the desired number of principal components is selected.
    - **Transform the Data**: The data is transformed using the selected principal components.

## Code Explanation

- **pca_reduction.py**:
    - The script for loading the dataset, applying PCA, and displaying the results.
    - Standardizes the data, applies PCA, and reduces the features based on input parameters.
    - Outputs the data with reduced features and plots if applicable.
